<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> more than five thousand years, the
ancestors of our little Swedish cousin have
dwelt in the Scandinavian peninsula. No wonder
she loves the stories of the Vikings, the
old legends, customs, and fÃªte-days. They
are her priceless heritage from the days of
long ago.</p>

<p>The snow and glaciers on the extreme north
cut off this long tongue of land, so that it
is as separate from the rest of Europe as
an island. In the olden days, almost every
Swede tilled the soil and lived remote from
his neighbour. Villages were few, so that each
family created its own little world of work
and pleasure. Even the children must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
very industrious and ingenious to help supply
the needs of the family. Whether she lives
in the city or the country, every little Swedish
girl to-day is taught this same thrift and
industry.</p>

<p>Because the winter months, when the sun
shows his face but a few hours each day,
are long and dreary, our northern relatives
fairly revel in their short summers. The
whole nation lives out-of-doors and rejoices
in the merry sunshine. All day excursions,
picnics, and water trips are crowded into the
brief season.</p>

<p>The peasant still owns his little red cottage
and the well-to-do farmer and the nobleman
live in their old homesteads. The cities
continue to be small in number and in size,
but slowly, slowly, the great throbbing life
of the outside world is creeping in to steal
away much of the picturesqueness of this
old nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>You will be surprised to learn in how
many ways the life of our little Swedish
cousin is similar to that of American children.
But she is such a very hospitable
and polite little maid, I am sure she will
give you a hearty welcome if you visit her
and see her for yourself at work and at
play.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SKATING CARNIVAL</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Sigrid</span>, Sigrid, hurry and get your skates.
The ice is at last safe, and mother says that
we may go to the park with Miss Eklund,
this afternoon."</p>

<p>Erik thrust his head through the nursery
door to announce the good news to his sister,
who was poring over her lessons for the
next day.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the little girl as she quickly
slipped out of her seat at the long table,
"I am so glad, for I thought I should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
have a chance to wear the new skates that
father gave me on my birthday."</p>

<p>In a trice, she had gathered up all her
books, packed them neatly away, and was off
to put on her warm furs. She was a flaxen-haired
little maid, with very blue eyes, and
plump rosy cheeks as round as an apple,
because she lived out-of-doors a great deal
and romped with her brothers.</p>

<p>In just no time at all, she had put on her
warm blue coat, lined with gray squirrel, and
a little cap to match, with the fur also on the
inside. She quickly fastened on her rubber
overshoes, which had a border of fur around
the top and down the front. When she had
found her white woolen mittens with a quaint
red and blue pattern knitted right across the
back, she was ready to join her brothers Erik
and Anders.</p>

<p>They were a jolly little party of merry-makers,
for it was the first skate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
season. Our Swedish cousins who live in
the city may not go skating whenever they
like. They must wait till some wise person
appointed by the government says the ice
is quite thick and firm.</p>

<p>"I will beat you running down-stairs to
the porter's door," called Sigrid, who was
bubbling over with good spirits. Away she
flew, down the long flight of stone steps, and
stood dancing up and down on one foot,
waiting for the others.</p>

<p>Sigrid's father was an officer in the king's
army, and in the winter-time, she and her
big brother Erik and her little brother
Anders lived with their parents and their
governess, Miss Eklund, in a large apartment
house in Stockholm. All the city people
in Sweden live in these houses, plain and
substantial on the outside, but comfortable
inside, and not so very unlike American
houses. In the centre of every house is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
great stone stairway, and at the entrance sits
a doorkeeper behind a tiny port-hole window.
Every one who came to call on Sigrid's
mother, who was a very hospitable lady, and
had many guests, must ring the porter's
bell. Then up would bob his head before
the little window to see if he should let
them in. He peered through the window
so quickly after any one rang the bell that he
always reminded Sigrid of a Jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p>"Gerda and Per are coming too," said little
Anders as he walked by Miss Eklund's side.
He had just learned to skate, so that he felt
quite grown-up to be allowed to go at all.
Everybody can skate in Sweden, so that the
children learn when they are very young.</p>

<p>The merry group crossed the street to the
left side, instead of to the right as we should
go, and started off briskly. Every few steps,
Sigrid would make a little bobbing courtesy
as she met some older friend. Such a funny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
little bow it was, made by quickly bending
the knee without stopping her walk.</p>

<p>"Brita has such a beautiful new foot-pusher
that her father has bought her," exclaimed
Sigrid. They had reached the open country
near the skating-park, and a couple of children
rapidly skimmed past them on these
strange sleds. "Don't you think that I am
old enough to have a foot-pusher now, Miss
Eklund?"</p>

<p>Christmas was very near and the air was
already full of secrets, so Miss Eklund smiled
to herself and replied, "Perhaps you might
ask the good father at home what he thinks
about it."</p>

<p>I don't believe that you know what a
"foot-pusher" or "kicker" is. I am sure
I don't know why you should. Picture to
yourself the framework of an ordinary sled
with two wooden rods fastened at right
angles to each runner. In the front part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
this odd-looking object, Brita had strapped
her skates to a low narrow seat. She stood on
one runner, grasped these rods, and gave a
quick little kick with the other foot, which
hastened the sled along at a lively pace.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Girl on ice " />
<div class="caption">BRITA AND HER FOOT-PUSHER</div>
</div>

<p>Soon the gleaming sheet of ice spread out
before them. Already it was quite dark
with people who were gliding merrily about.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sigrid, the band has begun to blow,"
cried Erik gleefully, for a Swedish ice carnival
is never complete without a band "to blow,"
as they say.</p>

<p>"When I came home from school this
noon," continued Erik, "I saw them thrusting
the little evergreen trees into the snow
around the seats."</p>

<p>Fir-trees and clumps of old beeches grew
on the snow-clad hills about the pond, but
this wreath of evergreen trees on the rim
of the ice, was to shelter the older people
who sat wrapped in furs to watch the sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those boys look like great white birds,"
said Sigrid, who was already fastening on
her skates. She stopped a minute to watch
a group of three boys who were skating
with sails attached to their backs,&mdash;big white
sails shaped like a capital A with the top
cut off.</p>

<p>"Now for a race," cried Anders, and away
they glided over the ice to find Gerda and
Per, who lived in the same big apartment
house.</p>

<p>Though it was only three o'clock in the
afternoon, the sun had already set, for you
will remember that in Stockholm the winter
days are very short, and in the middle of
the winter the lazy sun does not get up till
after nine o'clock in the morning. But the
twilight lingers for a long time, so that it
does not get dark for a couple of hours after
sundown.</p>

<p>All too soon, it was time to start for home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
but none of the children thought of teasing
to stay longer, for Swedish children are
taught to obey without asking why.</p>

<p>Already a couple of huge bonfires flamed
up along the shore. Just as they were leaving
the edge of the pond, a dozen dark figures
with blazing torches passed them. So
silently and swiftly did the little procession
twinkle by, that you might have thought
them will-o'-the-wisp lights. But the children
knew they were expert ski-runners, who were
bound for the smooth hillside.</p>

<p>The long white slope was just the best
place for the ski-lobing, and it was quite alive
with people, for no winter sport is more wildly
exciting. Every one wore narrow strips of
wood, sometimes twelve feet long, turned up
at the front, to the centre of which the foot
was firmly secured. At a given signal, they
placed their feet together, and down the
hillside they shot, as though they had wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never see ski-lobing without thinking
of the olden times when the fleet-footed
peasants on skis were our only postmen,"
said Miss Eklund.</p>

<p>"They can go over frozen rivers and hills
as straight as a bird flies," said Erik.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Eklund, "when we had
no post, the only way a message could be
sent in winter, was by these ski-runners. The
swiftest runner in a hamlet would start for
the nearest village. There he would give the
message to another runner to carry on to the
next hamlet. It is wonderful how soon they
could arouse the whole country.</p>

<p>"Instead of a letter, they carried staffs of
wood. If this stick was burned at one end,
it meant that a forest was afire. But if a red
rag was attached, then the enemy had invaded
the land and men were called to arms."</p>

<p>They were almost home now, and as they
turned a corner a rough shed appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the corner of a park. Several people were
just coming out. "Please, Miss Eklund,
may we stop just a minute to see the
ice figures?" exclaimed all the children at
once.</p>

<p>"You must be quick or we shall be late
to supper," replied Miss Eklund, who always
enjoyed these beautiful snow pictures as much
as the children.</p>

<p>Inside the low shed, was the figure of a
young mother, with a sad but lovely face,
who held a wee baby close in her arms. A
fierce wind seemed to swirl her draperies,
and she was trying to shelter the tiny creature
at her breast, while a little boy was weeping
bitterly against her skirts. The group was
made of snow and ice, yet so wonderfully
moulded were the figures, they looked like
pure white marble.</p>

<p>As they went out the door, Miss Eklund
slipped a coin into a little box which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
placed there to receive money for the poor at
Christmas.</p>

<p>"Elsa and Karl must have been out in
the country to see their grandmother," said
Sigrid, as a sleigh jingled past. The mother
and two children were cosily packed in front.
The driver stood on a little platform built
in the rear. A white net with a wide border
of tassels covered the back of the horse and
the dasher of the sleigh.</p>

<p>"Father," burst out Erik, as he came in from
the cold, "we did have the best time. Little
Anders can skate as well as the rest of us
now."</p>

<p>"Well," replied Major Lund, "you certainly
look as though you had enjoyed
yourself. But somebody will lose his porridge
if he is not ready for supper soon."</p>

<p>The family gathered about the table.
Before they began, the father turned to his
oldest child and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Erik, I believe it is your turn to say grace
to-night. Sigrid said it yesterday."</p>

<p>Every one stood while the boy solemnly
bowed his head and said the simple words.</p>

<p>Oh, they were so hungry! Didn't their
supper of rice porridge, flat rye bread, pancakes
and milk taste good! The three
children sat very quietly at the table and ate
all the food that was served them. Not a
spoonful of porridge or a crumb of rye bread
was left.</p>

<p>Perhaps you never saw Swedish flat bread.
Even the king's family eat these big brown
cakes, which are as much as a foot across,
and look like a thin, crisp cookie. They
have a large hole in the centre. In the
farmers' houses, they run a long pole
through this hole, and hang their bread
from the ceiling.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, each child rose
and shook hands with the father and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and said, "Tack fÃ¶r matin," or as we should
say, "Thanks for food." Then the parents
thanked each other. So many thanks may
seem very strange to you, but it is an old
and beautiful custom in Sweden.</p>

<p>"I am glad my little girl had such a happy
afternoon," said Mrs. Lund as she sat
embroidering with her daughter beside her.
"But there will be very little time for skating,
during the next few days. Christmas
will be here before we know it, and you can
help me about many small things."</p>

<p>"Mother, may I go with you to the
Christmas market this year? You know I
was sick and could not go last year," said
Sigrid.</p>

<p>"I remember, Sigrid," replied her mother.
"You must go to bed now, and we will plan
about it in the morning."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE KNITTING LESSON</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Won't</span> mother be surprised, Miss Eklund,
when she finds out how fast I have learned
to knit?" said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure she will be much pleased,"
replied Miss Eklund.</p>

<p>Sigrid was very soberly knitting a red
worsted square, while her governess sat near
to help her when the little steel needles behaved
badly. It was Sigrid's first piece of
knitting, so she was flushed and eager over
her task.</p>

<p>The morning sun poured through the
window on a pretty picture. Against the
heavy dark wooden chair, Sigrid's pale gold
hair shone and glistened. It was brushed back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
very tight and trim, for that is the way
Swedish mothers think little girls should
wear their hair. The two smooth braids were
fastened with a broad blue ribbon. Over
her plain dark blue woolen dress, she wore
a blue and white checked gingham apron.
Except for the aprons which she always
wore, Sigrid's dresses were much like those
of her little American cousin, only they were
very plain and simple. She did not have
any rings, or bracelets or necklaces. That
was not because she did not love the pretty
trinkets. Oh, no. But she must wait till
she is older.</p>

<p>The nursery where they were sitting was a
large comfortable room with a huge porcelain
stove which filled all one corner of the room
and reached way to the ceiling. It was made
of shiny green tiles, the colour of the walls of
the room, and down in the front were two
large brass doors, behind which was the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
This was the only kind of stove that Sigrid
had ever seen, so she never thought that it
was queer.</p>

<p>I must not forget to tell you about the
odd decoration of the nursery windows.
After the fashion of all Swedish windows,
they swung out from the middle like doors.
When the cold winter months came, on
went double windows. Though Sigrid was
the healthiest child in the world, she never
knew what it was like to open a window in
winter and let the fresh, pure air blow in, for
all around the inside of the frame were neatly
pasted narrow strips of paper. You buy
these strips at the store with mucilage on the
back like a postage stamp. In the little
narrow space between the two windows, Sigrid's
mother had planted bright green mosses and
gray lichens with tiny red cups. A little
wooden house and several painted wooden
men and women were placed in this miniature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
park, that kept green all winter. Sigrid
liked her window better than any in the house,
for all the others had only the mosses and
coloured berries.</p>

<p>"Before many months, I believe you will
be able to knit a pair of stockings," said Miss
Eklund, as she watched her industrious pupil.</p>

<p>"Did you have to make all your stockings
when you were a little girl?" said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I was smaller than you are
when I began to learn to knit, for my father
was a poor farmer and there was a large family
of us. The first thing I ever made was a
cozy for a coffee-urn, just as you are doing,"
said Miss Eklund.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me what you used to do when
you were a little girl. Did you learn your
lessons at home as Anders and I do?" asked
Sigrid.</p>

<p>"It was very different when I was your age,
for we lived way out in the country in a big red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
farmhouse, and our nearest neighbour was two
miles away. We lived in the far north, so
that when the winter days were only a few
hours long, I could not go to school, but I
learned a great deal at home. During the
long evenings, father and my big brothers
could not see to work on the farm or cut
timber, so we would all sit together in the
living-room with its huge open fire. Father
made mother's chairs or a cradle for the baby,
or whittled tools for the farm. Brother Olaf
carved wooden platters and spoons with
wonderful animals and figures. Then in the
spring-time he would sell these things in the
city markets.</p>

<p>"Mother used to spin and weave our warm
clothes, and she taught me how to do all
these things, besides sewing and embroidering.
Sometimes, father would tell us the same old
sagas that you children love to hear."</p>

<p>"Did you have to study catechism, too?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Sigrid's rosy face looked quite solemn at the
thought, for every day she had to learn a
portion of the catechism, and also Bible history.
She loved the stories of David and
Saul and Daniel in the lions' den, but the
catechism! Oh, that was very, very hard
for a little girl!</p>

<p>"All little Swedish girls must learn their
catechism, Sigrid, and my father was even
more strict than your good parents," replied
Miss Eklund.</p>

<p>"Elsa's big sister, who went to England
last year, says that English children do not
have to learn to knit and sew and embroider
just as they learn their geography and spelling.
Why do I have to learn to do these things,
when my father could buy them for me?"
asked Sigrid.</p>

<p>Just then, Sigrid dropped a stitch in her
knitting, and had to unravel two rows before
Miss Eklund could reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even though your mother lived in a
beautiful house and her father was very rich,
she also learned to knit and sew and crochet.
You must know how to do these things so
you will be able to take care of your own
home when you grow up. But it is time for
dinner now and I hear your mother's callers
going. Make haste and put your knitting
away lest she see her present."</p>

<p>Every morning, Sigrid had an early breakfast
with her brother Erik, who went to a private
school. He was studying very hard to go
to the university at Upsala. Then she must
study her lessons and learn many of the same
things which her governess had been taught
in the long winter months on the farm. And
after that came her gymnastic exercises every
day, as much a lesson as her reading and
spelling.</p>

<p>"Erik," called Sigrid, after dinner, as her
brother walked past the nursery. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
he was only three years older than his sister,
he was a tall, sturdy boy, and Sigrid felt very
proud of him. She beckoned him to a quiet
corner where they could whisper unobserved.</p>

<p>"I have a surprise for mother. Miss
Eklund has taught me to knit, and mother
does not know yet. If I can get it finished,
it is going to be a cozy for Christmas."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Erik, "but you wait
till I show you something which I learned
to make in my sloyd class at school." Erik
glanced around cautiously. Nobody was in
sight, so he drew a carved tray from his
school-bag.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's beautiful!" and Sigrid clapped her
hands with glee. "How could you make
it? Why, it is just like an old Viking ship
with the dragon's head peering at you from
the prow. And you have made the sides
like the scales of some strange monster.
Mother will be so delighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be splendid to be a big boy and
go to your school," continued Sigrid. "You
do such interesting things. I wish that I
could go on a school journey with my teacher
for two or three days and see some of our
wonderful old castles, as you do. Mother
says perhaps Miss Eklund and I may go
with her and father when they go through
the GÃ¶ta Canal to GÃ¶teborg, next summer,
to visit Aunt Frederika. That will be better
than a school journey."</p>

<p>"But, Sigrid, there are many wonderful
things to see right here in our own beautiful
Stockholm," said Erik. "Many school-children
come here every spring with their
teachers."</p>

<p>"Sometime you promised you would tell
me an old saga about Stockholm before there
was any city here," said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean about King Agne," said
Erik. "Once father pointed out to me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
place where he was supposed to have landed
with his ships, so I always like that story."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, that is the one. Do tell me,"
said Sigrid.</p>

<p>Erik loved to tell his little sister these
stories that he had often heard from his
mother and father, so he did not need to be
urged.</p>

<p>"Many hundred years ago, when the bold
Vikings sailed out from our harbours and conquered
far and wide, King Agne ruled in
Upsala. Where our city is to-day, was only
a group of green wooded islands with a few
huts. Late in the summer, King Agne came
sailing in from the Baltic, and dropped anchor
near the large island, where the king's palace
is to-day."</p>

<p>"Why, I can see that from mother's window,"
said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are so high up from the water,
we can easily see the island. These old Viking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
kings often went on voyages of conquest
along our shores. Way off to the east, King
Agne had warred against King Froste of
Finland and slain him. Then the victor
plundered the country and sailed over here
with much booty. He had taken captive the
king's beautiful daughter Skialf, his son Loge,
and many others.</p>

<p>"King Agne was exultant over his victory
and he wanted to make the Princess Skialf his
bride. So he said to his henchmen:</p>

<p>"'Let a spacious tent be erected beneath
that fine oak-tree on yonder tongue of land.
Then let my swiftest runners carry staffs of
invitation to all the chieftains round about
and bid them gather at a royal feast to celebrate
the wedding of King Agne and the fair
Princess Skialf. Command them that they
bring a goodly store of meat and drink for the
feast.'"</p>

<p>"Miss Eklund told us about the messengers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
staffs when we went skating, so I know
about them," interrupted Sigrid.</p>

<p>"These sticks were burned at one end, with
a noose at the other end. This was a very
plain way of telling the chieftains that they
would be hanged and their houses burned, if
they neglected to send the message on to
the next chief.</p>

<p>"So a large number gathered in the huge
tent which looked out on the Baltic, where the
dragon-prowed ships lay at anchor.</p>

<p>"All this time the poor princess was very
unhappy. But she dared not let the king
know her fears. She thought and thought
how she could escape becoming his bride.
Finally a plan grew in her mind and she said
to the king:</p>

<p>"'O brave and generous king, I beseech
you that, before the royal wedding feast, you
hold a funeral banquet in honour of my noble
sire. My lord, may you give ear to this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
favour which a captive maiden begs for her
father.'</p>

<p>"The princess prayed so piteously that the
heart of the old Viking was melted, and he
again commanded:</p>

<p>"'Let the two feasts for my slain enemy
and for my wedding be celebrated at the same
time.'</p>

<p>"The goodly company gathered around the
royal board, and fell to eating and drinking
with great zest. The grave-ale was handed
around in a huge drinking-horn, and the lusty
warriors drank so long and so deep that soon
they became boisterous and began to fight
among themselves.</p>

<p>"Now the king wore about his neck a long
and massive chain of gold. It was so long
that it hung way down on his chest. Many
other Viking kings had worn this royal treasure.</p>

<p>"In the midst of the carousal, the princess
whispered to the king:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"'My lord, have a care for your beautiful
gold necklace, lest you lose it during the
revels.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, my lovely bride, you are right.
What a prudent and careful wife you will
make!' said the king, as he coiled the chain
several times around his neck.</p>

<p>"Ere long, the fiery-hearted warriors were
so drunk with ale that sleep overcame them,
and one by one they fell from their places at
the table. As soon as they were soundly
slumbering, the princess rose from her place
by the king's side. She and the other captives
had only pretended to drink. She fastened
a ship's rope to the coil of gold about
the king's neck and then handed the rope
to her brother, who was outside.</p>

<p>"Whist! the men threw the rope over the
branch of the huge oak. Up went the tent
into the air, and the king was strangled with
his own golden chain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a horrible story!" said Sigrid with a
shudder. "What became of the princess?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she and the other captives hastened
away to the ships and sailed back to Finland.
When the Vikings awoke from their heavy
sleep, they were wild with rage. But there
was nothing to do but to bury the king beneath
a great mound of earth, which the waves
long since washed away."</p>

<p>"Ugh! I am glad I did not live in those
cruel days, aren't you, Erik?"</p>

<p>But Erik shook his head and laughed.
"Just think what fun it would be to sail away
in a brave ship, out on the wild ocean where
no man had ever been before. Those old
Vikings were as strong as giants and feared
nothing in the world. I must finish studying
my lessons now, but I'll tell you another tale
some other time."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>YULE-TIDE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I'll</span> bring you a gingerbread goat," said
Sigrid to little Anders as she started for the
Christmas market with her mother.</p>

<p>"Next year you shall go too, my son," said
Mrs. Lund. She kissed the little lad, who was
trying to look brave because he must stay
at home. From the nursery window, he
watched them as far as he could see down
the long avenue. Behind Sigrid and her
mother, a cheery-faced housemaid followed
at a respectful distance. She carried a huge
market-basket.</p>

<p>"Just think, mother. There are only three
days before Christmas. Won't it be jolly to
see grandma and Aunt Frederika and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
cousins?" said Sigrid, who was dancing along
beside her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. They will all be here by
to-morrow night," replied the mother.</p>

<p>"What crowds of people are on the street,"
said the child, as they wound their way
through the good-natured throngs.</p>

<p>"Most of them are bound for the same
place that we are," laughed Mrs. Lund, who
was rosy-cheeked and flaxen-haired like Sigrid.</p>

<p>"When we come to the big open space at
the top of this hill, where all the booths are,
you must keep very close to my side, for you
might easily lose me."</p>

<p>"I never saw so many little booths before,"
said Sigrid. "I like their white roofs, for
they look like snow. Do they always have
the Christmas market on this hilltop?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for hundreds of years the peasants
have been allowed to build their shelters here
and sell their Christmas wares. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
places, for months, the whole family has been
carving, knitting, weaving, and sewing all these
things that we shall see as we walk along,"
replied Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>"I see a booth with lots of little gingerbread
pigs and goats. May I buy one for
Anders, over there?" asked Sigrid.</p>

<p>"In a minute. But first I must get some
of old Brita's knitted caps for some poor children
I know."</p>

<p>They halted in front of one of these booths,
which have a few rough boards for a roof and
a narrow counter. Here was an old peasant
woman, so wrapped up in warm clothes
that you could scarcely see her pleasant,
wrinkled face. A black shawl was tied over
her head, and a second dark woolen shawl was
crossed over her breast and tied behind. Her
petticoats were so heavily wadded that you
wondered how she ever walked at all.</p>

<p>"Doesn't she look funny, mother?" whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Sigrid, who was clinging to her mother's
hand.</p>

<p>"Speak low, child," said Mrs. Lund. "I
would not have you hurt the old creature's
feelings. It is bitter cold standing here all
day. She needs all her warm clothes. As
long ago as when I was a child, she came here
to sell these garments that she knits and crochets
all summer.</p>

<p>"I think that must be King Oscar's sleigh
which has just come up the hill," said Sigrid
as they turned away from Brita's booth.</p>

<p>"Sure enough. He is making his annual
visit to the Christmas market. Let us stand
here and watch him for a minute."</p>

<p>Just then the big Christmas crowd burst
into a shout: "Long live King Oscar!"
The white-haired old gentleman, who is so tall
and stately that you would notice him anywhere,
bowed graciously to his people.</p>

<p>"Would he ask me what I wanted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Christmas, if I stood near him?" asked
Sigrid.</p>

<p>"No, he asks only the poor little children
who don't look as though they would have
a tree at home," replied Mrs. Lund. "Ah,
he is talking to that ragged little fellow who
watched us buy the accordion for Karl. By
and by, his servant will buy a lot of things
and give them to the children. He is a kind-hearted
man as well as a good king."</p>

<p>"Hear all those birds singing!" exclaimed
the child.</p>

<p>"Listen again and see if you cannot tell
where they are," said Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>"Why, I believe they are cuckoo whistles,
only I never heard so many all at once," cried
Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Suppose we go over and buy two or three,"
said Mrs. Lund. They threaded their way to
the booth where these cheap little clay birds
were so popular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The buxom maid was loaded with bundles
long before Sigrid wanted to go home.</p>

<p>For the next two days, there was a great stir
all over the house. Everything that could be
washed and scoured was made clean and radiant.
All the family were making presents.
Oh, such mystery everywhere!</p>

<p>"There, Miss Eklund," said Sigrid. "I
have finished the cozy. Now I want some
more red sealing-wax. I have helped Anders
wrap up his presents, and mine are almost
ready."</p>

<p>"Have you fastened on your rhymes?"
asked Miss Eklund.</p>

<p>"All except the one for Aunt Frederika's
present. I cannot seem to think of a verse
for her," was the reply.</p>

<p>"You must be sure and have a pretty verse
for your dear aunt, who has come way from
GÃ¶teborg. Perhaps I can help you later."</p>

<p>Miss Eklund left her little charge labouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with pencil and paper. Sigrid would never
think her Christmas gifts complete without a
verse for each one.</p>

<p>"Here come father and Erik with the tree,"
shouted Anders.</p>

<p>"Isn't this a beauty?" inquired Erik, as he
and his father rested for a minute.</p>

<p>"Did you get it in the Christmas market,
father? Mother and I saw a whole forest of
little Christmas trees there," said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Major Lund. "I wanted
to take you children out in the country and
cut it down myself. Sometime, when we have
Christmas at grandmother's, that's what we
will do. Then you all shall help choose the
tree before I cut it.</p>

<p>"No one must go into the parlour now," he
continued, as he carried the tree through the
doorway. "Mind you, not one peep till to-morrow
night." He shook his finger playfully
at the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I always like 'Dipping Day,'" said Sigrid,
the day before Christmas, to her brother Erik.
"It is such fun to eat in the kitchen."</p>

<p>She was waiting for her turn to dip the piece
of black bread on her plate, into the kettle of
sizzling hot fat. All the family, the relatives
who had come to spend the holidays and
the servants, stood about in the clean kitchen,
eating the noonday meal. The walls fairly
gleamed with copper and brass pans and kettles.
Even the brick oven had a fresh coat of
whitewash, in honour of the day. Every other
little Swedish girl over the land was eating her
dinner in the kitchen on that day, just as
Sigrid was doing.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room, a long table was
loaded with good things to eat. And here was
the big kettle in which the Christmas ham and
other meats had been cooked.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, when the children
returned from a brisk walk in the park, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
gathered in the nursery for afternoon coffee.
How Sigrid loved this coffee-drinking on
Christmas Eve! All the grown-up people in
Sweden drink a great deal of coffee. But Sigrid
was seldom allowed to have it except on a
few holidays.</p>

<p>The children could hear the pleasant chatter
of the older people, whose coffee was served in
the parlour. But they knew what was waiting
for them in the nursery.</p>

<p>On the little table there, a plate was prepared
for each child with a pyramid of different
kinds of bread. Some of these rolls were
in such odd shapes that I am sure you would
not call them bread at all. There was black
bread, white bread, saffron-coloured bread, some
shaped like little men and others like pigs and
goats. Of course there were gingerbread men,
and even chocolate bread figures.</p>

<p>Each little mound had candy and nuts
tucked away in the corners. The kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
candy which Sigrid liked best was done up in
a small package with bright paper. Pictures
and mottoes were pasted on the outside.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">

<div class="caption">"A SHEAF OF GRAIN IS FASTENED UP IN THE YARD OF
EVERY COUNTRY HOME"</div>
</div>

<p>I am afraid you will be getting as impatient
for the Christmas tree as Sigrid. But a Swedish
Christmas is the most joyous season of the
year. And the merrymaking often lasts three
weeks. Even the birds are not forgotten, for
a sheaf of grain is fastened up in the yard of
every country home for their Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>At last, the folding doors of the parlour were
opened by invisible hands. There stood the
tree ablaze with candles and ornaments, but no
presents. For a moment every one was silent
for the wonder of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lund began to sing the old carol,
"Now the Christmas Has Come," and the
others joined in.</p>

<p>After Major Lund had read the story of
the Babe in the Manger, the children caught
hold of hands and danced about the tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Round and round they spun. In a wink, the
circle broke and the long line of young people
went dancing in and out through the rooms of
the house.</p>

<p>"Come and join us, father," they shouted.
"Come, Aunt Frederika and mother." Soon
every one was drawn into the chain, even the
servants in the kitchen.</p>

<p>When they were out of breath with laughing,
singing, and dancing, they sat round a
large table near the tree.</p>

<p>"What is all that noise about?" exclaimed
Major Lund. He pretended to be surprised.
"Erik, there seems to be a great to-do outside
the door. Open it and see what is wanted."</p>

<p>Erik opened it a crack. In ran a little old
man with a long white beard. He wore a
rough gray jacket, knee-breeches, and a tall,
pointed red cap.</p>

<p>"The Tomt, the Tomt," cried Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Is there any naughty child here, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
doesn't deserve a present?" asked the gnome.
He hopped about and made a great deal of
noise for a small person.</p>

<p>Anders hid behind his mother's skirt. He
was always a little afraid of Tomt, who is much
like our Santa Claus.</p>

<p>"No, we haven't any naughty children," replied
the father.</p>

<p>"Then I shall leave some presents from
my packet," cried Tomt. He darted out into
the hall and came back slowly tugging some
large packages. Then he vanished as quickly
as he had come.</p>

<p>"Now, Erik, you may bring the baskets
and help me give out the presents," said Major
Lund.</p>

<p>Beneath the low boughs of the fir-tree were
several large baskets, heaped with presents.
Major Lund read aloud the verse on each neat
package before Erik passed it. Oh, such a
heap of presents for each and all! It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
quite late in the evening before all the bundles
were opened. What a hand-shaking and kissing
there was!</p>

<p>"I thought that looked like a foot-pusher
when Tomt brought it in," said Sigrid, who
shone with happiness over her new treasure.</p>

<p>"How proud I am of my children," said
Mrs. Lund, as Sigrid and Erik were thanking
her for their gifts. "I am sure I had no idea
you could knit so well. I shall use the cozy
for afternoon coffee to-morrow. And the
Viking ship tray is really beautiful, Erik."</p>

<p>Little children should have been abed and
asleep when the family finally sat down to
their supper. But it was Christmas Eve, and
nobody minded. Among all the good things
that Sigrid ate that night, I must tell you
about two dishes that every Swedish girl eats
for her Christmas supper,&mdash;lut-fisk and rice
porridge. The big bowl of porridge had a
crisscrossing of powdered cinnamon over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
top. Inside was one almond. The person
who found it would be the next one in the
family to be married.</p>

<p>For weeks, the Christmas lut-fisk&mdash;a kind
of fish&mdash;had soaked in lye. Then it was
cooked a long time. Whenever Sigrid lifted
a portion on her fork, it fell apart in delicate
flakes that were quite transparent.</p>

<p>"We must not forget to put out a dish of
porridge and milk for Tomt when he comes
back in the night," said Erik, as the children
were getting ready for bed.</p>

<p>"I'll bring Anders' little chair from the
nursery, because it is so low Tomt can reach
up to it," said Sigrid. "If I put it beside the
kitchen door, I am sure he will see it when he
comes in."</p>

<p>Early the next morning,&mdash;oh, very, very
early,&mdash;Anders crept down-stairs to see if
Tomt had been there.</p>

<p>"He drank all the milk and ate most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
porridge," cried Anders, in great excitement.
Then he ran back to let Miss Eklund finish
dressing him.</p>

<p>"It seems more like night than morning,"
exclaimed Erik. It was not six o'clock, but
the children were starting for church. Indeed,
it could not have been blacker at midnight.
But in almost every window that they passed
two candles burned brightly. When they
returned for their breakfast, after the joyous
Christmas service, the sun had not yet risen.</p>

<p>For days the festivities continued.</p>

<p>"Please, mother, may we keep the tree till
Knut's Day?" begged Anders on New Year's
afternoon. The candles had been relighted on
the tree for a party for some poor children.
The last happy child had gone home, loaded
with goodies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lund consented. But even Knut's
Day, the thirteenth of January, came all too
soon. Then the children helped to "rob the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
tree," as the Swedes say when they take off
its pretty trinkets. They looked very solemn
as one of the maids carried the tree into the
back-yard.</p>

<p>"Now Christmas is really over," mourned
Erik, "and school begins to-morrow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AT GRANDMOTHER'S</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Pera</span>, you do remember me, don't you?
Oh, you nice old dog!" Anders threw his
arms around the neck of a small shaggy yellow
dog that was wriggling almost out of his skin
with joy. You could not have told which was
the happier, the dog or the boy.</p>

<p>"Just think! I haven't seen you for six
months, Pera!" The two playmates romped
across grandmother's lawn to the porch, where
Erik was sitting on the steps with a tennis
racket, waiting for his father.</p>

<p>"Sigrid has been hunting everywhere for
you, Anders," said Erik.</p>

<p>"Here you are," exclaimed Sigrid a minute
later, as she spied Anders. "Larsson says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
there is a baby calf over in the barn, and he
will show it to us if we will go now."</p>

<p>Anders jumped up quickly, and followed by
the dog, the children ran toward the group
of barns and stables, at some distance from the
house.</p>

<p>"Look at all those wild strawberries in this
field," said Anders.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten that it was time for them.
I must ask grandmother if we can pick all we
want," said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"I want to see father's new sailboat. Have
you been down to the lake yet?" asked
Anders.</p>

<p>"No," said Sigrid. "Let's go around and
see everything. Mother says we shall stay all
summer, because poor grandmother is so old
and feeble she doesn't like to leave her. Larsson,
Larsson, where are you?"</p>

<p>The old farmer, who had taken care of the
grounds and farm for many years, hobbled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to the barn door to welcome the children
and to show them the new calf, the little
pigs, and the chickens.</p>

<p>No place in the world is quite so interesting
as grandmother's old house, whether you are a
Swedish or an American girl.</p>

<p>Sigrid's grandmother lived in a fine old
house on a hilltop which overlooked Lake
MÃ¤lar. It was only a short journey of two or
three hours from Stockholm, yet it was quite
out in the country, several miles from any
village. As you drove through the avenue
of huge beech-trees, you would be curious to
know why so many small, low-lying buildings
were grouped near the house. They were
placed to form three sides of a square, after the
fashion of many Swedish country places.</p>

<p>Off in the distance were the barns, which
the children visited, and another group of red
cottages, where the farm-helpers and their
families lived. These people lived in a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
world by themselves, with everything they
needed right on the grounds. If Mrs. Lund
wished fish for dinner, she could not send a
maid to market to buy a live fish from a tank
of water, as she did in Stockholm. Instead,
one of the servants caught the fish in the
lake, or she ordered smoked fish from the
storehouse.</p>

<p>On each side of the family residence were
houses for the servants. Some of the small
separate sheds were used for washing, baking,
tools, and provisions. But you would enjoy
a peep into some of these buildings with the
children.</p>

<p>The new sailboat was anchored at the
wharf near the bath-house. "Father has
promised to teach Erik how to sail this summer,"
said Sigrid. They were clinging to the
wharf railing, so that they could get a glimpse
of the little cabin, with its two bunks and red
cushions. "I am glad you learned to swim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
last summer, for now we can have such sport
when Karin and Elsa get here."</p>

<p>Sigrid had learned to swim when she was
very small. Look in your geography and you
will see that almost one-tenth of the whole
surface of Sweden is covered with lakes and
rivers. There is water, water everywhere.
Just fancy how miserable a Swedish mother
would be if her little daughter could not
swim!</p>

<p>The door of the storehouse stood open
when the children climbed the hill from the
lake, so they slipped in after Svea. On the
outside, it was just a mound of grassy earth,
with a door cut in the grass, but no windows.</p>

<p>"Isn't it cool in here!" exclaimed Anders.
"Svea, aren't you going to skim the
milk?"</p>

<p>"Later in the day, Anders," said the maid,
who held her lantern up over her head while
she hunted for the sausages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>From above, hung long strings of sausages,
smoked hams, and fish. In the dim light of
the lantern, the children could see the big
round cheeses and the bins of potatoes. The
pans of milk were set to cool in another room
of this queer storehouse.</p>

<p>"I wish you would give us some lingon
jam," said Sigrid. "The kind we had last
year, Svea."</p>

<p>"Wait till I open a new jar. Now, run
ahead, for I want to lock the door," replied
Svea. She had not forgotten how the children
had teased her the summer before for their
favourite jam of red Swedish berries.</p>

<p>"Next week will be the time for washing.
Perhaps mother will let us ride down to the
lake when the clothes are carried there," said
Sigrid. She tried to lift herself up on the
window-sill to look into the wash-house, where
the huge copper kettle was ready to boil the
clothes, but she was not tall enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind," she said. "We can get
into the bake-house, I am sure. Sometime,
Svea says, I may help her bake bread. It
must be almost time now, for she hasn't made
any for several months."</p>

<p>In the city, Sigrid's mother bought her rye
bread from a baker, but grandmother had her
bread baked three or four times a year in this
little house. Most of the room was filled by
the huge stone fireplace, which was heated to
a high temperature. Then the coals were
raked off and the rye bread cooked on the hot
stones.</p>

<p>"What does she do with this flat round
piece of wood with a short handle?" asked
Anders, who was exploring.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sigrid, "it is a great lark to
watch her. She rolls out the batter quite thin,
and slips that wooden shovel beneath each
cake. Then she takes this other wooden
spade with a long handle, shakes the cake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
from the little spade to that one, and thrusts it
on the hot stones. Svea does it very quickly,
but she laughed when I asked if it was
hard, so I don't believe it is as easy as it
looks."</p>

<div class="caption">BAKING RYE BREAD AT GRANDMOTHER'S</div>
</div>

<p>"Don't you think it is time for dinner?
I am so hungry," said Anders.</p>

<p>"Guess what we are going to have to-day,"
said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Pancakes and jelly," Anders replied
promptly.</p>

<p>"No, sour milk, with powdered ginger on
top."</p>

<p>"Let's run, then," said Anders, "because I
don't want to be late and have father say
I cannot have any."</p>

<p>But they arrived in season and ate their full
share of the white curds, which they always
enjoyed.</p>

<p>Inside of the old house, you would be
amazed at the size of the rooms. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they were simply furnished, there was much
choice old carved furniture, lovely plants, and
vines, so that the rooms were very cheery.
The floors were scrubbed beautifully clean and
covered with rugs. Everywhere was exquisite
order and neatness.</p>

<p>As in the city home, the children had a
large nursery, where they always played during
the little time they were indoors. A trapeze
hung between the nursery and an adjoining
room; a large cushion rested beneath. On
rainy days, the children hung from this indoor
swing and climbed the ropes like young
monkeys.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four, five," counted
Sigrid, as she sat on the porch a few days after
their arrival. "Why, are all those old women
going to help with the washing to-morrow,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we shall need them all. Larsson
has arranged for them to sleep at some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
servants' houses, so they will be ready to begin
very early in the morning."</p>

<p>The queer procession of old women, with
coloured kerchiefs tied over their heads, slowly
filed down the road. Long before the children
were awake the next morning, a fire had
been lighted in the wash-house beneath the
monster kettle, and the women were at
work.</p>

<p>Wasn't that a lively week, though! Sigrid's
mother was an excellent housekeeper,
but she never had all the clothes and linen
of the family washed but three times a year!
Such scores and scores of garments went into
that copper kettle&mdash;enough to clothe a whole
village. Even if her family had been quite
poor, Sigrid would still have had many more
dresses and aprons than her American cousin.</p>

<p>By the time the oxen were harnessed to a
long, low wagon with latticed sides, Sigrid and
Anders were ready to climb in and ride to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
lake with the old women and the tubs of
clothes which had boiled in the kettle.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at a clean, sandy
beach near the wharf, the children hopped out
of the wagon.</p>

<p>"Let's sit in the rowboat at the end of the
wharf," said Anders. "Then we can play
we are pirates and watch the women on the
shore."</p>

<p>The washerwomen took off their shoes and
stockings, pinned up their skirts, and waded
into the water. Then there was such a splashing
and rinsing of clothes, and bobbing of
kerchiefed heads, and swinging of long arms!</p>

<p>"They are bad children. We must beat
them very hard," one wrinkled old woman
explained to Anders. She had carried her
pile of dripping clothes from the water's edge
to a big stone, where she pounded them with
a flat wooden beater. "But they will be as
white as a lily when I am done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Later all the garden bushes were spread
with garments. You needed only to half-close
your eyes to fancy a summer snow-squall had
whitened the green grass over a large area.</p>

<p>"Everything in the house will be fresh and
sweet for Midsummer's Day," sighed Mrs.
Lund, when the last washerwoman had returned
to the country district where she lived.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MIDSUMMER'S EVE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> looks more like the mast of one of the
big ships in the harbour than anything else,"
said Erik. He and his father were standing
beside the huge May-pole which lay flat on the
green grass in grandmother's front lawn.
Near by several men were hammering away on
a large wooden platform, in the centre of which
the pole was to be hoisted.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, I have often thought so.
This pole is not more than fifty feet high. I
have seen them twice as tall. But if we are
going to cover all these cross-bars with birch
boughs and wreaths, we must hitch up old
Maja and drive into the woods soon."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you must," said Mrs. Lund, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
she hurried across the lawn with a huge wreath
of daisies over her arm and a basket of nodding
bluebells. "You will find us under that
clump of beeches, making our wreaths, when
you return. Oh! there is plenty for every one
to do before the pole is trimmed for to-night."</p>

<p>"Mother, you do make wreaths so fast,"
said Sigrid. She was sitting in the midst of a
group of friends and relatives, who had gathered
at grandmother's to celebrate Midsummer's
Eve and the day following. As she
talked, she sorted daisies, or "priests'-ruffs," as
she called them, into bunches for her mother.</p>

<p>"Just hand me a clump of those white
daisies, so I can tie their long stems to this
rope, and you will soon see how I do it," said
Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>"To-night will be the longest of the whole
year," said Miss Eklund, while her fingers
plaited birch leaves. "How I love these long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
days of sunshine! Why, last night I read in
my room without a lamp till almost eleven
o'clock!"</p>

<p>"Please tell Karin and me about how you
made pancakes on Midsummer's Eve when
you were a little girl, Miss Eklund," begged
Sigrid, who, with her cousin, was sitting near
the governess.</p>

<p>"Oh! the young girls out in the country
where I used to live will have a merry time
of it to-night. I wonder if they still make
pancakes. I was about sixteen years old the
night I tried it with two other girls, for the
charm would not work unless there were
three. Together we took the bowl from the
cupboard, beat the eggs, and added the flour.
All three of us stirred it at once and threw
in the salt at the same time. Of course, we
got in too much salt. Not one of us must
speak or laugh the whole time. That was
the hardest of all. Dear me, I hadn't thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of that night for years." Miss Eklund delayed
her tale to laugh as heartily as if she
was making up for lost time.</p>

<p>"After we had poured out the batter and
cooked it, each of us ate a third of the very
salt cake. But we couldn't drink before we
went to bed. During our dreams, the older
girls told us that a young man would appear
to each of us and offer us a glass of water."</p>

<p>Karin interrupted the story by exclaiming,
"What is that coming down the road? I
believe it is the boys with our green boughs.
Old Maja doesn't look as though he liked
those branches thrust behind his ears. Why,
the wagon is all one bower of birch-trees!"</p>

<p>As the wagon drove into the yard, Erik
spied his newly-arrived cousin and sung
out:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"There once was little Karin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who at the royal hall</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Among the handmaids serving</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The fairest was of all.</span><br />
<br />
"Then spoke the King, 'Fair Karin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wilt thou my sweetheart be?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My horse and golden saddle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'll straightway give to thee.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The children all laughed merrily at the new
turn to the familiar old song.</p>

<p>"How pretty we shall make the May-pole!"
exclaimed Sigrid.</p>

<p>She called it a "May-pole," though it was
the middle of June. The Swedish word for
"May" means green leaf. And a "green-leaf
pole" it certainly was when they had draped
the cross-bars with leaves and garlands and
added scores of the yellow and blue flags of
Sweden.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the afternoon, the pole
in its gala-dress was swung into place by means
of huge ropes. Then a great shout went up
from the little crowd of relatives and working
people who lived on the grounds.</p>

<p>"Strike up a dance, Per," cried Major Lund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to the fiddler. In a twinkling, the children
had caught hold of hands and were dancing
around the pole. Old and young, servants
and all, shared in the merrymaking.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 344px;">

<div class="caption">"IN A TWINKLING, THE CHILDREN .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. WERE DANCING
AROUND THE POLE"</div>
</div>

<p>As Sigrid ran about in a gay costume, you
would scarcely have recognized her. Instead
of her plain city clothes, she wore a pretty
peasant dress. Many fashionable Swedish
mammas let their children wear this dress on
holidays in the country. Over her dark blue
woolen skirt, Sigrid wore a bright apron,
striped in red, blue, yellow, black, and white.
The waist was white, with a red silk bodice and
shoulder-straps. An embroidered kerchief
was folded quaintly about her throat. On her
yellow braids rested a tall pointed blue cap,
with red pipings and tassels in back. Several
other little girls at the dance wore similar
dresses.</p>

<p>"Erik," said Sigrid, quite late in the evening,
as the fiddler stopped to tune up for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the next dance, "several times to-night I
have seen some one over by the well-sweep. I
thought perhaps he was one of the farmers'
children. But he hides there as though he
was afraid to come out."</p>

<p>"Suppose we go over and speak to him,"
said Erik.</p>

<p>When they reached the well-sweep, no one
was there.</p>

<p>"I know that I saw him only a minute ago.
There, I think he is behind that elm-tree.
You run this side and I will go the other,"
said Sigrid.</p>

<p>All escape was cut off this time, and Erik
dragged the cowering child from his hiding-place.</p>

<p>"If he isn't a chimney-sweep!" exclaimed
Erik when he saw the boy away from the
shadow of the tree.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid of us, little boy,"
said Sigrid, kindly. "You can't help it because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
you have to go down into the chimneys and
your face is always black with soot. Don't you
want something to eat?"</p>

<p>The sooty youngster grinned and shifted
his coil of rope from one shoulder to the other.
He managed to murmur, "Thank you."
Sigrid ran ahead to the kitchen to get some
salt herring, rye bread, and coffee. The little
sweep left his long broom and rope on the grass,
and began to eat greedily.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ever afraid to go down inside of
a pitch-black chimney?" asked Sigrid. Her
interest in the dances had waned for a few minutes,
for she had never talked with one of these
forlorn little creatures before.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head in reply. He was
too busy with his salt herring to waste any
words.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask mother if she will let
him stay here all night," said Sigrid. She
did not know that this outcast, who was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
shy with her, could take very good care of
himself. All summer, he wandered through
the country, cleaning chimneys. At night, he
slept in strange barns or haymows and was
very happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lund talked to the lad and told him
that he could spend the night in one of the
outhouses. The next day was a holiday and
no one would want a chimney swept.</p>

<p>Sigrid's tender heart was at ease again, and she
returned to the dancers. The older people
stayed up far into the bright night, but the
children soon went to bed. From her chamber
window, Sigrid could see the huge bonfires
on the hillsides far away. The witches are
abroad on Midsummer's Eve, and these fires
drive them away.</p>

<p>Every one goes to church on Midsummer's
Day, which is also called St. John's Day. So
the next morning, the Lund family drove
several miles to a little country church. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
they started, Sigrid went to find the sweep.
But the little wanderer had started on his travels
again.</p>

<p>"Larsson says all the school-children will
sing carols, this morning," said Mrs. Lund.
"I am sure we shall have a beautiful service."</p>

<p>As they drove along the road, they met
many country people on their way to church.
The women all carried their hymn-books
wrapped neatly in a silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Why do the men all sit on one side and
the women on the other?" whispered Anders.
His family sat in a little gallery of the church.
Down below, the altar and the square box
pews with doors were banked with lilacs.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear," replied his mother. "You
must remember the country people are used to
it, so it is not strange to them."</p>

<p>The ride home and the noonday meal
seemed endless. As soon as ever they had
thanked their parents for their food, the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were out-of-doors again. A big wagon,
trimmed with birches and filled with hay, was
ready at the door. Midsummer's Day without
a picnic in the woods is almost as bad as
Christmas without presents.</p>

<p>"Don't forget the nets for the crayfish,
Erik," said Major Lund, who was stowing away
luncheon baskets in the wagon.</p>

<p>"They are in all right, father. The big
kettle in which to boil them and the coffee-pot
are under the seat," said Erik.</p>

<p>Even a plain every-day picnic, where you
eat sandwiches and cakes under a tree, is fun.
But on this picnic, the children were going
to help catch crayfish, which look like small
lobsters. Then they were planning to cook
them over a camp-fire.</p>

<p>The last child nestled into the hay and they
were off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A VISIT TO SKANSEN</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I want</span> to see the Lapps and the reindeer.
Aren't we almost there?" said Anders to his
mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, little son, we are nearly at the top of
the hill," replied Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>The Lund family were on their way to
Skansen, a famous park near Stockholm. Soon
the car stopped and every one scrambled out.</p>

<p>"We are so high up that we can see the
harbour," said Erik, as he trudged along beside
his sister with one of the luncheon baskets
hung over his arm. At their feet lay the
city of islands with its ribbon-like canals of
blue. Away on the horizon, the water of the
bay sparkled in the sun, like a huge amethyst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
The children halted a minute to look back
on the fair scene.</p>

<p>"Out there the Vikings sailed away to
new lands," said Erik, who was never weary of
dreaming about the heroes of the old sagas.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, children," called Mrs. Lund.
"We have too much before us to see, to
spend time looking back."</p>

<p>Through the entrance gate, they passed
into a grove of pines and birches, with
winding roads. Among the trees were many
wild animals in pens, and queer houses and
buildings, such as the children had never seen
in the city or at grandmother's. Every few
steps, they met a soldier with a helmet and
shield, or a brightly dressed peasant. You
would think you had come to a foreign
country, and so did Sigrid.</p>

<p>As they turned a bend in the road, they
saw a low cottage of hewn timber. It was
painted red and had a hood over the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
In the yard was a wagon that might have
been made by sawing a huge wooden cask
from top to bottom, and then placing one
half on wheels.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a funny cart," said
Anders.</p>

<p>"It is odd," replied his father. "A long
time ago, people used to ride in a wagon
like that. Suppose we go over and look at
that house."</p>

<p>"You don't know the people who live
there, do you, father?" enquired Sigrid.</p>

<p>"No, my daughter," he replied. "But all
these people are accustomed to visitors. You
see, a few years ago, there lived a wise man
named Artur Hazelius, who loved his
country very dearly. He travelled from the
fjelds and glaciers where the Lapps live to
the fertile fields of SkÃ¤ne, in the south.</p>

<p>"Something troubled him very much.
He cared a great deal for the queer old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
homes which he saw in out-of-the-way villages.
No one makes such houses to-day.
He knew they would soon be destroyed.
Then he was sorry that only a few peasants
still wear their old gay costumes.</p>

<p>"So he said to himself, 'I will go to the
king and ask him to give me a large park.
There I will fetch some of these houses.
Our children will not have to read in
books about the way their great-grandfathers
lived. They shall visit the very
houses they lived in.'"</p>

<p>"How could he bring a whole house
here?" asked Erik.</p>

<p>"That was hard sometimes," Major Lund
replied. "Often they pulled down a house,
brought the timber here, and set it up as
it was before. Then he had people come
here and wear the same clothes and live in the
same way they did in the olden times. Nowhere
in the world is there a park like this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"See that little girl with a kerchief over
her head, peeping at us from the window,"
said Anders.</p>

<p>A moment later, a smiling peasant
woman came to the door. She made a
curtsey and invited them to enter.</p>

<p>"Why, I can scarcely see at all," said Sigrid.</p>

<p>The big living-room was lighted by the tiniest
little window. The two sleeping-rooms were
also as dark as your pocket, and very small.
Hemlock tips were strewn over the clean
floor. From the ceiling hung a pole of flat rye
bread.</p>

<p>"You dear baby!" exclaimed Sigrid's mother,
for she had discovered a small canvas hammock
hung in a dark corner. The baby was asleep
in its hanging nest.</p>

<p>"She is a very good child and lies there all
day by herself," said the baby's mother.</p>

<p>"They never can move their beds at all,"
said Sigrid, who was making a tour about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
room. She peered curiously between some
striped hand-woven curtains which hung in
front of a wooden bed, built into the house.
Similar beds lined the walls.</p>

<p>"Many of the peasants use that kind of
bed," said Major Lund. "Once, when I was
in Lapland, I slept in a big drawer."</p>

<p>"Was that the time that you were snowed
in and you climbed out through the chimney to
dig a path?" asked Erik.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the same time," said his
father.</p>

<p>"I should think you would have smothered
in the drawer," said Anders, who had been
very quiet.</p>

<p>"There was no danger of that," replied Major
Lund. "All around the rooms were wooden
sofas. At night, you pulled out a big drawer
beneath the seat. The drawer was filled with
hay, and over that you spread blankets."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lund talked to the peasant woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
while the children continued to look about.
A huge fireplace filled one corner of the room.
On a low brick platform that came out into the
room, the fire was built.</p>

<p>Across another corner a rope was stretched.
Over it hung dresses and coats.</p>

<p>"What do they do that for?" whispered
Sigrid to her mother.</p>

<p>"They haven't any closet for their dresses
except that," replied Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>For a moment or two, after they came out
of the gloomy interior, the sun was dazzling.
They ate dinner under some pine-trees, and
then kept on through the woods.</p>

<p>"We haven't time to visit all these houses.
But you would like to see the hut half-buried
in the ground. The herdsmen live in such
places in summer while they are tending
their cattle. And we won't forget the Lapps,
Anders," said the father, gently tweaking his
son's ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are all those people in that carriage?"
asked Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>"I had almost forgotten that this is Bellman's
day. Those people live here. They
always dress in the costume of the time of our
beloved poet on his anniversary day."</p>

<p>An old carryall drove slowly past. Within
were several men dressed in black velvet coats
and knee-breeches, white wigs, and three-cornered
hats.</p>

<p>"Later in the day, we will walk over to
Bellman's statue, where I am sure we shall
find many people."</p>

<p>"I see the reindeer," exclaimed Anders.
"There they are on those high rocks."</p>

<p>Before them stretched the group of Laplander
tents of birch poles covered with canvas.</p>

<p>"That dark-skinned girl playing with the
dog looks about my age. I wonder what she
does with the wooden spoon which hangs from
her belt," said Sigrid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go and ask her, if you like," said Mrs.
Lund. "I don't believe that she will understand
you. That tent has the flap turned
back. Do you see that flat stone in the
centre? Her dinner is cooked in a big kettle
on that stone. When the meal is ready,
she will dip her ladle into the kettle for her
share."</p>

<p>"Over yonder is the summer-house of our
famous seer, Swedenborg. It used to be in
his garden in Stockholm, and there he worked
and wrote," said Major Lund, nodding in the
direction of a neat pavilion.</p>

<p>"We have just time before the dances to
see the people who are celebrating Bellman's
day," said Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>Wreaths and flowers decked the bronze bust
of the poet. At the foot of the pedestal a
man was reciting, and the crowd was very quiet.</p>

<p>"How he loved to come here and lie out in
the warm sun and sing those same songs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
man is reciting!" said Major Lund. They
lingered only a few minutes.</p>

<p>"This is what I like," said Sigrid, with an
air of great content. She and her brothers
had hurried ahead of their parents. They sat
watching some lively dancing on a large platform.</p>

<p>"They have begun 'Weaving Homespun,'"
said Erik, as the fiddler and accordion player
struck up a quaint air.</p>

<p>The peasants faced each other in two lines.
Then the men and maidens wove in and out
in the figures of the dance. "Like weaving
on an old loom," Erik explained to Sigrid.</p>

<p>"I wish I could have a red dress and a
stiff white cap with pointed ears," said Sigrid,
who could not keep her eyes away from one of
the dancers.</p>

<p>"The crown princess also admires that
dress," said Mrs. Lund. "She requires all her
maids of honour to wear it, in the forenoon, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Tullgarn. I am sure it is so pretty, I don't
believe they mind at all."</p>

<p>"No two of those girls are dressed alike,"
continued Sigrid, who was still interested in
costumes.</p>

<p>"That is because each maid wears the peasant
dress of one of the provinces of Sweden,
and there are many provinces. One of those
Dalecarlian girls has a dress like the one
you wore on Midsummer's Eve. In that part
of the country, the girls wear their bright
aprons and kerchiefs more than anywhere else
in Sweden."</p>

<p>"Why, where is Anders?" asked Major
Lund. He had been chatting with an old
friend and had just returned to his family.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the lad had disappeared. The
crowd had pressed in close about the platform.
Every one was so pleased with these old folk-dances,
that they had forgotten the child.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he has gone back to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
at the seals or the polar bears?" asked
Erik.</p>

<p>It was sometime before Major Lund returned
from his hunt. But Anders was with
him.</p>

<p>"Where do you think I found the rogue?"
asked Major Lund. "He was drinking raspberry
juice with a nice old lady who thought
he was lost. Do you know what happens to
little boys who run away?"</p>

<p>Major Lund looked very stern. But the
mother was so glad to find the child that I
don't believe anything did happen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THROUGH THE GÃTA CANAL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gong clanged. The big steamer
churned the water into foamy suds as it left
the wharf at Stockholm. Sigrid and her father
and mother waved their handkerchiefs to the
friends on shore as long as they could see
them.</p>

<p>"Let us find seats in the bow of the boat,
where we shall have a good view of the canal,"
said Mrs. Lund.</p>

<p>"I never was in such a large boat before.
It is just like a house," cried Sigrid, who was
much excited.</p>

<p>"Wait till you see the small state-room with
the red plush sofas that turn down at night for
a bed," said Major Lund. "We must leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
all these posies there before we come on deck
again."</p>

<p>All three of them had their arms full of
flowers which their friends had brought them.</p>

<p>"How long will it take us to get to Aunt
Frederika's house, father?"</p>

<p>"Nearly three days. You will enjoy the
trip, Sigrid. We are to cross the whole of
Sweden. But we shall see beautiful country
and many old castles before we reach GÃ¶teborg.
You won't have to stay on the steamer all the
time, for we shall often get off at the locks
and wander through old towns."</p>

<p>"Wherever shall we sleep?" Mrs.
Lund asked with a smile. The great mass
of flowers almost filled the tiniest room
you ever saw. They finally had to throw
some of them away when they went to
bed.</p>

<p>"I wish Erik and Anders could have come
too," said Mrs. Lund when they were on deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
again. She almost never took a journey without
her whole family.</p>

<p>"Grandmother would be very lonely if we
were all gone. Our two weeks' trip will soon
be over," replied her husband.</p>

<p>"Father," said Sigrid, a few hours later,
"sometimes the canal is not much wider than
the boat. Why, it seems just as if we
were riding on top of the land instead of the
water."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know what you mean." Major
Lund was amused at the child's distress of
mind. "We shall go through several places in
the canal, so narrow that trees on opposite
banks arch over the boat. But when we reach
the big lakes you will think we are at sea.
Sometimes they are so broad, you cannot see
the shore."</p>

<p>"I thought it was the GÃ¶ta Canal all the
way," said Sigrid.</p>

<p>"So it is," replied her father. "But that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
like a family name for wide rivers, big lakes,
and little short canals that all join hands to
make a waterway across the country."</p>

<p>Long before bedtime, Sigrid felt quite at
home in her new quarters. After supper, she
again sat on deck with her parents.</p>

<p>Suddenly, they heard a sharp cry. "Oh,
Isabella, you will drown! Can't you get her,
father? What shall I do! Oh! Oh!"</p>

<p>Several people hastened to the side of the
boat where the cry rose. A pretty child was
weeping bitterly, while her father was trying to
comfort her.</p>

<p>"She has only lost her doll in the water,
madam," explained the gentleman to Mrs.
Lund, who was eager to help. He spoke in
English.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" asked Sigrid, who was
too far off to hear.</p>

<p>"She dropped her doll overboard while she
was waving her hand to some children on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
shore. Poor child! she is all alone with her
father."</p>

<p>"Is she an English girl?" asked Sigrid.</p>

<p>"I think she is an American. Perhaps she
would like some of your twisted ring cakes,
when she stops crying."</p>

<p>When the child's sobs finally ceased, Mrs.
Lund said to her kindly:</p>

<p>"Won't you come and sit beside my little
daughter? She wants to give you some of her
cakes."</p>

<p>The two children glanced at each other
shyly.</p>

<p>"May I, father?" asked the American child.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Anna. You are very kind to
amuse her," said the stranger politely to Mrs.
Lund.</p>

<p>Sigrid could speak in English as well as
Swedish, which seemed to surprise Anna.</p>

<p>"What nice sweet pretzels!" said Anna as
she nibbled at one of the cakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother bought them of a peasant girl who
came on board at that funny place where the
banks were so high we couldn't see the town,"
explained Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Did you bring your doll with you?"
asked Anna, who still mourned the lost
Isabella.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Sigrid, "and a whole trunk
of clothes. Wait a moment and I will get
her."</p>

<p>She returned with a pretty yellow box on
which red and blue flowers were painted.
Grandmother had a large chest at home exactly
like this toy.</p>

<p>"Oh! you have a peasant doll. How I
wish I had one like that! Mother bought
Isabella for me in Paris," said Anna.</p>

<p>During the next two days of the trip, the
little girls were often together.</p>

<p>"What a giant stairway! I don't see how
the steamer can go up to the top," Sigrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
exclaimed, the next morning. They had
reached the town of Berg, and as she looked at
the canal before her, she saw seventeen locks,
which mounted to the sky.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/i109.jpg" width="346" height="500" alt="Children watching a boat in the canal" />
<div class="caption">THE GÃTA CANAL</div>
</div>

<p>"But it can," said Major Lund. "Hundreds
of vessels climb those locks every year.
It will take several hours, so that we may as
well go ashore.</p>

<p>"When we come to Vadstena, Sigrid, we
shall have just time to cross the drawbridge
and visit a grim old castle there. Gustaf Vasa,
our first Swedish king, built it more than three
hundred years ago."</p>

<p>"Didn't we have any kings before him?"
asked Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Major Lund. "But he was
the first king to unite our people and make
Sweden a strong nation."</p>

<p>"Mother and I took a trip once while we
were in Stockholm. Some one pointed out the
Castle of Gripsholm, where a nobleman named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Vasa hid during the 'Blood Bath of Sweden.'
Was that the same man?" asked Anna, who
was standing near.</p>

<p>"Erik told me all about that once," replied
Sigrid. "I am sure he is the same man.
King Christian, the Dane, ruled Sweden then.
He was very cruel, Anna. Why, he murdered
so many Swedish noblemen that people call
that time 'The Blood Bath.' No one knew
who would have his head chopped off next."</p>

<p>Anna shuddered. "Did they kill Gustaf
Vasa?"</p>

<p>"His father was slain, but Gustaf Vasa
fled away into the mountains," replied Sigrid.
Ever since she was a baby, she had heard these
stories of the old kings. They were real
people to her.</p>

<p>"He had many wild adventures in Dalecarlia.
Sometime, if you go there, Anna, you
will see where he lived. The people there
loved him dearly and wanted him for king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
instead of the tyrant Dane," said Major
Lund.</p>

<p>"Do tell me about his adventures, Major
Lund," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Ask Sigrid; I am sure she knows," he
replied.</p>

<p>Sigrid's eyes shone with delight. "I know,
I know," she exclaimed. "He cut off his
hair and put on homespun clothes, so he looked
like a peasant. Then he worked in the mines
and on farms."</p>

<p>"Didn't the peasants know who he was?"
asked Anna.</p>

<p>"Some of them did. They wanted to save
him from the Danish soldiers. Father saw a
house where a woman helped him to escape.
She hung a towel from a window. With
that for a rope, he climbed down and ran
away.</p>

<p>"The story I like best is the one about the
farmer who hid Gustaf Vasa in a load of straw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
The soldiers thrust their spears all through
the straw, but they could not find him.</p>

<p>"One spear did wound him. The farmer
feared the soldiers would return and see the
blood-stains on the snow. So he took his jack-knife
and cut a small place on his horse's leg.
When the soldiers came back, they saw the
red spots on the white ground. The peasant
showed them the wound on the horse and they
were satisfied."</p>

<p>"Don't forget about Margit's quick wits,"
said Major Lund.</p>

<p>"She was a peasant woman in whose house
Gustaf Vasa stayed," continued Sigrid. "One
day she heard the soldiers coming.</p>

<p>"'My lord, where shall I hide you?' she
cried.</p>

<p>"That day she had brewed a huge tub of
Christmas ale. In a second, she thought of a
plan.</p>

<p>"'Here, hurry down this ladder.' She pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
up a trap-door in the kitchen floor and he
fled into the cellar. By the time the soldiers
reached the gate she had pulled the tub of
ale over the trap-door. The soldiers never
guessed where the prince was."</p>

<p>"I suppose they caught him, at last," said
Anna.</p>

<p>"That's the best part," said Sigrid. "After
a long time, he gathered an army. Then he
fought the Danes and made them give up
Sweden for ever."</p>

<p>"Did you ever fight in a real war, Major
Lund?" asked Anna, after a minute of silence.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he replied. "Awhile ago,
when Norway wanted her own king, many
people feared war between Norway and Sweden.
But everybody is glad that Haakon,
the new King of Norway, was chosen without
blood-shed."</p>

<p>"That Frenchman you were talking to this
morning, father, called King Oscar a 'Bernadotte.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
What did he mean?" asked
Sigrid.</p>

<p>"He was only referring to King Oscar's
French ancestor. King Karl XIII, who lived
a hundred years ago, had no children. So the
people tried to decide who should be the next
king. Finally they chose a famous French
officer, named Bernadotte, who fought under
Napoleon. He was elected crown prince."</p>

<p>"I am sure that must be Vadstena in sight
now," said Mrs. Lund. "It will be pleasant
to go ashore for awhile. Grandmother asked
me to buy her some of the lovely lace they
make here."</p>

<p>"You will have to be quick, if you want to
see the castle, too," said Major Lund.</p>

<p>The last few hours of the journey, they
steamed down the GÃ¶ta River toward the city
of GÃ¶teborg.</p>

<p>"Gustaf Adolf chose well when he built a
city at the mouth of this river," said Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Lund to his wife. They were watching the
huge rafts of timbers that were floating on their
way to the seaport.</p>

<p>"Was he any relation to Gustaf Vasa?"
asked Sigrid.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gustaf Adolf was his grandson. A
nobler and braver king never lived," replied
Major Lund. He spoke with the love and
reverence which every Swede feels for Gustaf
Adolf, the greatest king the nation ever had.</p>

<p>"I do hope Aunt Frederika will be at
the pier to meet us," said Sigrid as they
approached the landing. "Oh, I think I see
her! No, I don't."</p>

<p>But Aunt Frederika did find them, and
welcomed them warmly. Such a fine visit
they all had together! Erik and Anders heard
about little else for the rest of the summer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NAME-DAY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer months had winged themselves
away. All through the golden days, Sigrid
had lived in the sunshine, as blithe and merry
as an elfin maid. To be sure, there had been
a short lesson nearly every day with Miss
Eklund, for Sigrid's mother did not believe
that her little girl should spend all the holiday
months in frolicking.</p>

<p>September had come, and with it hints of
long lesson days and a return to Stockholm.
But in the excitement over Sigrid's name-day
party, it was easy to forget such unpleasant
things. Karin, Elsa, and Karl, the cousins who
had also been making a long visit with their
grandmother, had begged to be allowed to stay
for the party. Several little friends who lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in fine villas on the lake were coming to
spend the day.</p>

<p>"Be sure to call me at five o'clock in the
morning, Miss Eklund," said Elsa, on the
evening before the party.</p>

<p>Miss Eklund promised, so Elsa arose at an
early hour and awoke the others. Followed
by them, with their arms full of flowers
and green leaves, she tiptoed into Sigrid's
room.</p>

<p>"Hush, Anders, your boots squeak. We
must not waken her. That would spoil
everything," whispered Elsa.</p>

<p>"Hang the end of your garland over the
bedpost, so," continued Elsa. She festooned
the brass post of Sigrid's bed with the long
chain of green leaves. Then she silently
motioned to her sister Karin to do the same
with her end.</p>

<p>"I'll tie this bunch of bachelors'-buttons to
the corner of the foot-board where she will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
them when she first opens her eyes," whispered
Karin.</p>

<p>"My, doesn't it look pretty!" said Elsa.
The children then filed out into the hall
and peered through the doorway. Sigrid's
rosy cheeks were half-buried in her plump arm,
which was thrown up over her head. She
appeared to be soundly sleeping in the midst
of a huge nosegay of posies and green leaves.</p>

<p>"Now I wish she would wake up,"
exclaimed Anders in a very loud whisper.</p>

<p>Elsa put her hand over his mouth, but not
before the quiet figure in bed stirred a little.
Suddenly Sigrid sat upright, rubbed her eyes,
and clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Who did it?" she cried aloud.</p>

<p>In rushed the children, and then there was
much laughing and kissing. Each child very
politely congratulated Sigrid because it was her
name-day. Even in the midst of a jolly good
time, Swedish children do not neglect these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
graceful forms of speech which their parents
have carefully taught them.</p>

<p>"Here comes Svea with a tray," somebody
called out.</p>

<p>The children made way for the neat and
smiling maid. On the dainty tray which she
placed in Sigrid's lap, was a cup of steaming
coffee and a plate of crisp caraway cookies.
You might think that she had been sick, so
that every one was trying to cheer her on
her name-day. Dear me, no. Sigrid always
had coffee and cakes served to her in bed every
birthday and every name-day, just as if she
was a grown-up society lady.</p>

<p>Anders and Karin sat on the edge of the bed,
and the others drew up their chairs while Sigrid
sipped her coffee.</p>

<p>"My big sister has two name-days," said
Elsa.</p>

<p>"Does she have three parties every year?"
asked Sigrid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied Elsa. "Her real
birthday comes in January. Then her name-days
are in July and October. I wish I had
two name-days. But mother says there are so
many of us children that if we all had two
name-days, we should be having a party about
once in every three weeks all the year."</p>

<p>Everybody burst into laughter. Elsa had
five brothers and sisters, so what her mother
had said was quite true.</p>

<p>In Sigrid's land, you see, they name all the
days of the year. When a little girl is born,
she is generally given a name in the calendar.
Sigrid's birthday was in March, but Sigrid day
in the calendar is in September. So she had
two parties every year.</p>

<p>"Name-day greetings, little daughter," said
Mrs. Lund as Sigrid came into the dining-room
for breakfast. Again there was much
kissing and hand-shaking. Sigrid's chair at
the table was draped with festoons of leaves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
As she ate her breakfast in silence, she could
not keep her eyes away from one corner of
the room. There stood a little table covered
with a snowy cloth. The centre was heaped
with bundles of all shapes, done up in white
paper with red sealing-wax. On the white
cloth "Sigrid" was written with almonds and
raisins.</p>

<p>What good fun it was, after breakfast, to
open all the mysterious bundles! Such a
heap of pretty things were concealed!</p>

<p>"Here is 'Little Women,'" said Sigrid in
great delight. "How did you know it was
just what I wanted, mother?" For the tenth
time Sigrid got up to run and kiss her mother.
The green and gold bound book from which
she had torn the wrapping was a translation of
Louisa M. Alcott's story, which is as dear
to the little Swedish girl as to her American
cousin.</p>

<p>"No lessons to-day," said Miss Eklund,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
as the children came out of the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Erik. "Won't you
take us for a sail on the lake, father? You
promised to go with us once more before I
started for school."</p>

<p>"Sigrid's name-day would be a fine time to
go. Let me see. How many of you are
there?" Major Lund looked around at the
bright faces. Gerda and Per and several other
neighbours had already arrived. "Twelve&mdash;just
two more than you are years old,
Sigrid."</p>

<p>"You had better start early," said Mrs.
Lund. "Remember the party this afternoon."</p>

<p>Just as if any one could forget!</p>

<p>The boys helped Major Lund to unfasten
the boat from its moorings. A puff of wind
filled out the white sail and they were soon off.</p>

<p>"They thought I was asleep this morning
when they were trimming my room," Sigrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
confided to Erik, who was showing her how to
steer the boat.</p>

<p>"Fie on you, Sigrid!" said Erik, quite
seriously, but he gave her plump cheek a little
pinch.</p>

<p>"It was such fun," Sigrid laughed softly.
"When I heard Elsa tell Anders his boots
squeaked, I thought I couldn't keep quiet a
second longer."</p>

<p>"Look at all those snipe, Erik," Major
Lund interrupted. The boat was sailing quite
close to the shore. Several of these long-legged
birds, which were picking their way
across the beach, were startled by the voices
and flew into the air.</p>

<p>"What a queer call they have, uncle," said
Elsa.</p>

<p>"Listen a moment till you hear it again,"
said Major Lund.</p>

<p>They were very quiet for a couple of minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"It sounds like the noise old Maja makes
when he wants us to give him a lump of
sugar," said Gerda.</p>

<p>"They make that sound with their wings as
they fly," said Major Lund. "The 'horse-cuckoo,'
some people call the snipe. Do
you know how it received that name?"</p>

<p>"Do tell us, father," said Anders.</p>

<p>"It is just a short story about a careless
farmer who had a lazy servant. For many
days, the servant rode his master's horse to
pasture without giving the poor animal any
water to drink. That was a very dry summer,
so the horse suffered greatly.</p>

<p>"One day the farmer wanted to drive to
market. So he said to his servant:</p>

<p>"'Fetch my horse from the pasture.'</p>

<p>"The servant went after the horse, but it
had disappeared. He delayed so long that
the master finally followed him into the field.
But he could not find the horse either. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
as they had given up the search, they heard a
neigh. In the next meadow, where they had
been hunting, they saw the horse drinking
at a spring.</p>

<p>"'Are you really there?' cried the farmer.
He hastened over the stone wall to catch the
horse. As he was about to put the halter over
its neck, the horse disappeared and a snipe
flew into the air. There the bird neighed till
sunset."</p>

<p>"That served the farmer quite right," said
Erik, indignantly, and the others agreed with
him.</p>

<p>The broad waters of Lake MÃ¤lar were
alive with sailing craft and small steamers.
Who would stay indoors on such a day!
Along the wooded slopes of the lake they
sailed past many a lovely villa, half-hidden
by trees, and occasionally some ancient
castle.</p>

<p>"That is the place where I saw a water-sprite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
late one afternoon," said Sigrid. The breeze
had died down and the boat seemed to rest at
anchor near an old wooden bridge beneath
which a hillside brook rushed joyously into
the lake.</p>

<p>"Did you really?" asked Elsa. Sigrid believed
in trolls, sea-nymphs, fairies, and water-sprites.
But Elsa was several years older than
her cousin, and she wasn't at all certain that
trolls and water-sprites still lived in the wild
country, though they might have in the olden
times.</p>

<p>"Look underneath the bridge in that dark
corner, just behind those rushes. Erik was
rowing me home from your house, Gerda.
When we got just there, something white and
misty rose up out of the water. I heard a
soft, sweet note, and Erik thought perhaps he
did too. Then I thought I saw him dimly
resting on the waves, just as Miss Eklund says
water-sprites do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Weren't you frightened?" asked Karin in
wide-eyed surprise.</p>

<p>"I wanted Erik to stop rowing so I could
listen, but he wouldn't. Mother said he must
never take me there again toward night.
Father, won't you tell us the story of the water-sprite
and the budding staff, while we are waiting
for the wind to come up?" begged Sigrid.</p>

<p>"It doesn't look as though we should do
much sailing for awhile. But you must all
know the old legend, I am sure," said Major
Lund.</p>

<p>"We should like to hear it just the same,"
the children all chimed in.</p>

<p>"Well," began Major Lund, "this water-sprite
lived under an old bridge just like that
one over there. He was such a happy fellow
that he sat playing his harp half the livelong
day. One afternoon, a grim and sour-faced
old priest came ambling along on his horse,
over the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suddenly he drew rein, for he heard the
sweetest music. He rode back across the
bridge and hunted several minutes before he
discovered the merry sprite.</p>

<p>"In his ugliest tone of voice the priest
called out:</p>

<p>"'Why do you play your harp so joyously?
Have you nothing to do but idle away the day
and the night in such foolishness? A lazy
sprite like you will never get to heaven. I
should sooner expect to see this staff which
I carry grow green and blossom, than find
you there.'</p>

<p>"The water-sprite threw down his harp in
great terror and began to weep bitterly. What
had he ever done that the old priest should
frighten him so?</p>

<p>"Without giving further heed to the sprite,
the priest rode on. For many years, his own
life had been so dull and solemn, that it made
him bitter to see other people happy. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
found a cruel pleasure in making the little
sprite wretched.</p>

<p>"While he was buried in his own gloomy
thoughts, he did not see that the staff in his
hands was slowly changing into the green
branch of a living tree. Tiny green buds, then
leaves, slowly, silently unfurled. As silently
flower-buds appeared and opened into rosy
blossoms, spicy with fragrance.</p>

<p>"The priest, at last, beheld the branch of
leaves and flowers in his hand. He was filled
with great wonder at himself. While the dead
staff of wood slowly bloomed in his hands,
something hard and cold in his heart seemed
to melt. Not since he was a small boy had
he listened to the singing of the birds with
such joy. He dismounted from his horse
to gather a handful of wild lilies-of-the-valley.</p>

<p>"He even smiled on a whistling peasant boy
who passed him on the road. Then he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the weeping sprite. In all haste he rode back
to the bridge.</p>

<p>"To the sobbing lad, he said:</p>

<p>"'Behold how my old staff has grown green
and flowers like a rose-bush in June. This is
a symbol, my good fellow, that hope blooms
in the hearts of us all. You may yet go to
heaven.'"</p>

<p>At that minute, the limp sails stirred, the
ropes rattled in the breeze, and the boat was
soon under way.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, the other guests of
the party arrived. I could not begin to tell
you all the games they played. Some were
like those of their American cousins, but there
were many new ones. Next to "Blind Man's
Buff," and "Last Couple Out," the best fun
was "Lend, Lend Fire."</p>

<p>All the children sat in a circle for this game.
Karin, who had a cane, walked up to Erik and
rapping on the floor, said, "Lend, Lend Fire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>But Erik replied, "Go to the next neighbour."
Half-way around the circle Karin
went, but every one made the same answer.
In the meantime, the children were beckoning
across to each other and exchanging seats.
Finally, Karin was nimble enough to slip into
a chair which was vacant for a second. It
happened to be Sigrid's place, so it was her
turn to take the cane and hunt for fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lund played for the children to dance
old-fashioned ring dances. Sigrid would no
more have thought her party complete without
these dances in a big circle than if there had been
no name-day cake. For of course she had
a name-day cake. It did not have any candles,
and it was not like any birthday cake you ever
saw. Across the top of the round loaf of
sweetened bread, "Sigrid" was written in
twisted strips of bread, with cardamom seeds
and currants sprinkled all over.</p>

<p>Where could you find a prettier, cosier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
supper-room than within the round lilac hedge
with its wide opening for a door? Here the
table was set for the guests.</p>

<p>Inside the lilac-bush hedge, with her other
guests, we must say good-bye to our little
Swedish cousin. Sometime, I hope you will
cross the seas and meet her again. She is such
a winsome maid, so healthy, happy, and well-mannered,
that I am sure you would soon be
good friends.</p>

<div class='adtitle3'>The Little Colonel. <span class='small'>(Trade Mark.)</span></div>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine
is a small girl, who is known as the Little Colonel, on
account of her fancied resemblance to an old-school Southern
gentleman, whose fine estate and old family are famous
in the region.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>The Giant Scissors.</div>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in
France. Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel, and
in later volumes shares with her the delightful experiences
of the "House Party" and the "Holidays."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Two Little Knights of Kentucky.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel's Neighbors.</span></p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is not,
however, the central figure of the story, that place being
taken by the "two little knights."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>Mildred's Inheritance.</div>

<p>A delightful little story of a lonely English girl who
comes to America and is befriended by a sympathetic
American family who are attracted by her beautiful speaking
voice. By means of this one gift she is enabled to
help a school-girl who has temporarily lost the use of her
eyes, and thus finally her life becomes a busy, happy one.</p>
